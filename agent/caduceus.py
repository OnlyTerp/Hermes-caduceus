"""Caduceus — Hermes-native deep-planning mode.

Caduceus is Hermes's native answer to Claude Code's "UltraCode". When it's on,
the agent works like the Devin CLI: it raises reasoning effort and drives a
*visible, todo-driven plan* — decompose the task with the ``todo`` tool, execute
one step at a time, mark progress live, delegate parallelizable grunt work to
subagents, and verify before claiming done. The heavy "Loom" dynamic-workflow
engine (see :mod:`agent.workflow`) is the *explicit* escalation for parallel
fan-out — reached only when the user says "workflow"/asks to orchestrate, never
automatically.

A single toggle (``/caduceus on|off`` or the desktop switch) flips the mode;
model tiers, effort, and budget have sensible defaults and are power-user-only
overrides in the ``caduceus:`` config section (not surfaced as command knobs).

This module is the single source of truth for:

* the per-session :class:`CaduceusState` (mode flag, tiers, budget, reminder
  bookkeeping);
* the model-visible **prompt stack** — the standing reminder, the
  enter/sparse/exit lifecycle reminders, the workflow-keyword reminder, and the
  full ``Workflow`` tool description (ported verbatim where model-visible,
  adapted only for Python/Hermes tool names);
* the abstract ``effort`` → provider ``reasoning_config`` mapping; and
* orchestrator/worker tier resolution used by ``delegate_task`` and the Loom.

It is intentionally self-contained so Caduceus stays an *additive* fork: hot
files (run_agent, conversation_loop, system_prompt, delegate_tool) touch it only
through small, well-named hooks.

WORKFLOW_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """\
Execute a workflow script that orchestrates many subagents deterministically. Returns when the workflow finishes; progress streams live to the Orchestration Theater. Each subagent is a Hermes delegate child running on the worker tier.

OPT-IN: only call this when the user opted into multi-agent orchestration — they said "workflow"/"workflows", they asked to "fan out / orchestrate with subagents", or a skill told you to. (Caduceus being on is NOT such an opt-in — see below.) Otherwise answer directly, plan with the `todo` tool, or use delegate_task for a single subagent.

**Caduceus.** Caduceus being on does NOT mean "always run a workflow." Under Caduceus you plan with the `todo` tool and dispatch individual subagents with delegate_task; that handles most work. Use THIS tool only when the user explicitly opts into multi-agent orchestration — they said "workflow"/"workflows", asked to "fan out / orchestrate with subagents", or the task clearly needs large parallel orchestration (e.g. "audit every module", a big map-reduce). When you do author one, aim for the most exhaustive, correct answer and scale the fan-out to the task (a simple ask = a small workflow; "audit thoroughly" = larger fan-out + adversarial verify). Multi-phase work = several workflows in sequence, reading each result before the next. Don't over-deliberate before authoring: scout briefly only if you must, then write the script and call this tool.

SCRIPTS ARE PYTHON, NOT JAVASCRIPT. Define `meta` (a pure literal) and an async `main()`. Use the injected globals directly — do NOT import them, do NOT wrap the script in markdown fences, do NOT use const/let/var or `=>` arrows.

    meta = {
        "name": "review-changes",

    }
    FINDINGS = {"type": "object", "properties": {"findings": {"type": "array"}}, "required": ["findings"]}
    VERDICT = {"type": "object", "properties": {"isReal": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["isReal"]}

            async def vone(f):

Injected globals (no import):
- agent(prompt, *, label=None, phase=None, schema=None, model=None, isolation=None, agent_type=None) -> await it. Without schema returns the subagent's final text (str). With schema (a JSON Schema dict) it returns a validated object (the subagent is forced to return JSON; it retries on mismatch). Returns None on failure — filter with `[x for x in results if x]`. Omit `model` (inherits the worker tier); set it only to escalate one hard leaf.
- pipeline(items, *stages) -> await -> list. Each item flows through all stages independently, NO barrier (item A in stage 3 while B in stage 1). THE DEFAULT for multi-stage work. Each stage is called (prev_result, original_item, index) — take only the args you need. A raising stage drops that item to None.
- parallel(thunks) -> await -> list. Runs zero-arg callables concurrently; BARRIER (awaits all). A failing thunk resolves to None (never raises) — filter None before use. Use ONLY when stage N genuinely needs ALL of stage N-1 (dedup/merge, early-exit on zero, cross-item comparison).
- phase(title), log(message): narrate the Theater.
- budget: .total (int|None), .spent(), .remaining(). HARD ceiling — agent() raises once spent>=total. Loop with `while budget.total and budget.remaining() > 50_000: ...`.
- args: the verbatim `args` input (None if absent).
- workflow(name_or_ref, args=None) -> await: run a saved workflow / {"scriptPath": ...} inline (one level deep).
- Quality-pattern helpers (all async): adversarial_verify(claim, n=3), perspective_verify(claim, lenses), judge_panel(attempts, criteria), loop_until_dry(finder, k=2, key=None), multimodal_sweep(searches), completeness_critic(state).

DEFAULT TO pipeline(); reach for parallel() only for a real barrier. Concurrency is capped per workflow; total agents are capped as a runaway backstop. Subagents reach the session's tools via Hermes toolsets and are told their final text IS the return value, so they return raw data.

Standard pure builtins + the `json` and `math` modules are available. `time`, `random`, and wall-clock are NOT (they break resume) — pass timestamps via `args`, stamp after return, vary randomness by index.

To iterate or resume: the result includes a runId and the persisted scriptPath. Edit that file and re-invoke with {"scriptPath": ..., "resumeFromRunId": ...} — unchanged agent() calls return cached results instantly; the first edited/new call runs live. Same script + same args = 100% cache hit."""
